# Fitness-Management-System

In the sports industry, fitness management systems have become increasingly popular among sports centers, gyms, and health clubs. These systems are designed to help 
sports center members achieve their fitness goals by providing personalized workout plans, tracking progress, and providing feedback.

This project involves the creation of a Fitness Management System using MySQL specifically tailored for sports centers. The goal of this project is to provide a 
comprehensive platform that can be used by sports center staff to manage their members' fitness routines, track their progress, and provide personalized 
recommendations based on their fitness goals.

The system will allow sports center members to input their personal information, including age, weight, and fitness goals, and will generate customized 
workout routines that are tailored to their specific needs. Additionally, the system will track their progress over time, allowing members to see their 
improvements and adjust their workouts accordingly.

Overall, the Fitness Management System using MySQL will provide sports centers with an innovative and effective tool for managing their members' fitness 
routines and helping them achieve their fitness goals.
